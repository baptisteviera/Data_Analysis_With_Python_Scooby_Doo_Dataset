The goal of this project is to apply the data analysis techniques seen during the SY09 course to one of the tidy tuesday datasets. We have chosen the dataset gathering the data
on the episodes of the series "Scooby-Doo".

Our study of the dataset consists of two distinct problems: a classification problem and a regression problem. 

For the classification problem we looked at the "monster-real" column and tried to classify the episodes according to whether the monster(s) encountered by the gang were only humans in disguise (when monster-real is false) or were genuine supernatural creatures (when monster-real is true). 

For the regression problem we tried to predict the variable "IMDB" from the data: this quantitative variable describes the imdb score (a site specialized in movies and television) obtained by the movie
or the episode in question.
